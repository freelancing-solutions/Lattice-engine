# OpenSpec Integration for Lattice Engine

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of OpenSpec (Fission-AI's spec-driven development framework) into the Lattice Engine, enabling structured specification workflows that align humans and AI coding assistants before any code is written.

## Motivation
- **Spec-Driven Development**: <mcreference link="https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec" index="1">1</mcreference> Implement OpenSpec's approach where specifications become executable and directly generate working implementations
- **Human-AI Alignment**: <mcreference link="https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec" index="1">1</mcreference> Ensure human and AI stakeholders agree on specs before work begins
- **Deterministic Outputs**: <mcreference link="https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec" index="1">1</mcreference> Lock intent before implementation for reviewable, predictable results
- **Structured Change Management**: <mcreference link="https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec" index="1">1</mcreference> Keep scope explicit and auditable through structured change folders

## Core Features
