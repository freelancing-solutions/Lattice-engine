# Lattice Mutation Engine Implementation Tasks

## Project Overview

The Lattice Mutation Engine is a comprehensive system for error analysis and automated fix generation. This document outlines the complete implementation tasks across all components of the system.

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of three main components:

1. **BugSage Dashboard** - Frontend interface for error visualization and management
2. **BugSage Backend** - API server for error processing and fix generation
3. **Integration Layer** - Communication and synchronization between frontend and backend
