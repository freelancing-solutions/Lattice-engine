# Getting Started with Lattice Engine

Welcome to Lattice Engine, the revolutionary platform that brings agentic coding to your development workflow. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started with your first project.

## What is Lattice Engine?

Lattice Engine is an AI-powered development platform that enables agentic coding – where AI agents can understand requirements, write code, and even refactor existing codebases. It combines the power of large language models with sophisticated code analysis and generation capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18 or higher installed
- A code editor (we recommend VS Code with our extension)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript
- A Lattice Engine account (sign up at [lattice.ai](https://lattice.ai))

## Installation

### 1. Install the CLI

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g @lattice/cli
\`\`\`

### 2. Initialize Your Project

\`\`\`bash
mkdir my-lattice-project
cd my-lattice-project
lattice init
\`\`\`

### 3. Install the VS Code Extension

Search for "Lattice Engine" in the VS Code marketplace and install the official extension.

## Your First Project

Let's create a simple web application to understand how Lattice Engine works.

### Step 1: Create a Specification

Lattice Engine works with specifications that describe what you want to build. Create a file called \`spec.md\`:

\`\`\`markdown
# Todo App Specification

## Overview
A simple todo application with the following features:
- Add new todos
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos
- Filter by status (all, active, completed)

## Technical Requirements
- Use React with TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Store data in localStorage
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Add unit tests
