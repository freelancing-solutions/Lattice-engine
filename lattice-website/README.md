## 🎫 Support Ticket System

This application includes a comprehensive support ticket system for customer service and issue tracking.

### Features

- **Ticket Creation**: Users can create support tickets with categories, priorities, and detailed descriptions
- **Ticket Tracking**: Public interface for users to track their ticket status and view conversation history
- **Admin Dashboard**: Complete admin interface for managing and responding to tickets
- **Threaded Conversations**: Support for ongoing conversations between staff and customers
- **Status Management**: Ticket statuses (Open, In Progress, Waiting Response, Resolved, Closed)
- **Priority Levels**: Priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) for proper triage
- **Category Classification**: Organize tickets by type (Bug, Feature, Integration, Billing, Other)

### Setup

1. **Configure Database**:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env

   # Configure your PostgreSQL connection
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/lattice_website"

   # Set up database schema
   npm run db:setup
   ```

2. **Optional Email Configuration**:
   Configure SMTP settings in your `.env` file to enable email notifications:
   ```
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   SMTP_FROM=support@lattice.dev
   ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@lattice.dev
   ```

### Routes

- `/support` - Main support page with ticket creation form
- `/support/tickets/[ticketNumber]` - Public ticket tracking page
- `/admin/tickets` - Admin dashboard for managing tickets
- `/admin/tickets/[ticketId]` - Admin ticket detail page

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/support/tickets` - List tickets with filtering and pagination
- `POST /api/support/tickets` - Create new support ticket
- `GET /api/support/tickets/[ticketId]` - Get ticket details with messages
- `PATCH /api/support/tickets/[ticketId]` - Update ticket status or priority
- `POST /api/support/tickets/[ticketId]/messages` - Add message to ticket

### Database Schema

The support system uses PostgreSQL with these models:

- **SupportTicket** - Main ticket entity with metadata
- **TicketMessage** - Individual messages in ticket conversations
- **TicketAttachment** - File attachments (prepared for future use)

### Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: The admin routes are currently accessible without authentication. In a production environment, you should:

1. Implement authentication using NextAuth.js (already installed)
2. Add middleware to protect admin routes
3. Use role-based access control for admin features
