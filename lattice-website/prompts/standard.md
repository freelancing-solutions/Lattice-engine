# Lattice Website Messaging Standardization Prompt

## Objective
Revise all user-facing content in the `lattice-website` repository to accurately communicate Project Lattice's core mission, value proposition, and ecosystem architecture. The messaging must clearly differentiate Project Lattice from generic development tools and emphasize its unique approach to **spec-driven agentic development**.

---

## Core Messaging Framework

### What Project Lattice IS:
- **A unified ecosystem for spec-driven agentic development** that brings order, traceability, and coherence to multi-agent software development
- **An orchestration platform** where AI coding agents (Claude, Gemini, GLM, DeepSeek, etc.) collaborate under a unified mutation framework
- **A solution to fragmented agentic development** where specs, agents, and codebases remain synchronized across all projects
- **A spec-first development paradigm** where specifications define behavior, not ad-hoc code changes

### What Project Lattice is NOT:
- Not a traditional CI/CD tool
- Not a standalone code editor or IDE
- Not just another project management system
- Not a single-purpose bug tracking tool

---

## Key Value Propositions (Use These Throughout)

1. **Unified Spec Management** - All specifications across all projects in the ecosystem are centrally managed, preventing duplication and conflicts
2. **Agentic Orchestration** - Multiple AI coders work collaboratively under intelligent coordination
3. **Cross-Project Traceability** - Every bug, feature, and change traces back to originating specs across the entire ecosystem
4. **Mutation-Driven Evolution** - Features evolve through validated spec mutations rather than disconnected code changes
5. **Autonomous Error Resolution** - Through BugSage integration, production errors automatically generate specs and deploy fixes
6. **Interconnected Ecosystem** - All components (Mutation Engine, Portal, Website, BugSage) function as one unified system

## Navigation & Section Revisions

### **HOME PAGE**

#### Hero Section (Above the Fold)
**Current Generic Approach:**
```
Home
Features
Documentation
Blogs
```

**Revised Approach:**
```
Hero Headline: "Spec-Driven Development for the Agentic Era"

Hero Subheadline: "Unified orchestration for AI coding agents. One ecosystem, infinite coders, zero chaos."

Hero CTA: 
- Primary: "Start Building with Specs"
- Secondary: "Explore the Ecosystem"
```

#### Value Proposition Section
**Key Message:** Stop fighting fragmented agentic development. Project Lattice synchronizes all specs, agents, and codebases in one unified mutation framework.

**Three Core Pillars:**
1. **Spec-First Architecture**
   - Every feature begins as a specification
   - Specs define behavior, not code
   - All agents work from unified spec definitions

2. **Agentic Orchestration**
   - Multiple AI coders collaborate intelligently
   - Automatic task assignment and conflict resolution
   - Real-time coordination across projects

3. **Ecosystem Unity**
   - Changes in one project ripple through all related systems
   - Cross-project traceability and compatibility
   - No isolated development silos

#### Problem/Solution Framework
**The Problem:**
Modern agentic development is chaotic. Different AI coders introduce specs independently, creating duplicated functionality, conflicting implementations, and lost traceability. Debugging becomes impossible when you can't track which spec caused which bug.

**The Lattice Solution:**
Project Lattice creates **one unified system** where:
- All specs are centrally managed and validated
- All agents work from shared specifications
- All changes are traceable to originating specs
- All projects remain synchronized and compatible
