I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

## Current State

The `lattice-website` folder contains a Next.js 14+ marketing website with:
- Existing pages: home, downloads, support, status
- Navigation component with links to: Home, Features, Documentation, Downloads, Status, Support
- Footer component that **already references** the missing pages: `/about`, `/blog`, `/privacy`, `/terms`
- Consistent page structure: Navigation → main content → Footer
- SEO patterns using Next.js Metadata API
- Structured data components for schema.org markup
- Theme support (dark/light mode)
- Framer Motion animations throughout

## Missing Pages

The footer links to four pages that don't exist yet:
1. **About** (`/about`) - Company/team information
2. **Blog** (`/blog`) - Blog landing page
3. **Privacy Policy** (`/privacy`) - Legal privacy policy
4. **Terms of Service** (`/terms`) - Legal terms

Additionally, the footer bottom section (lines 147-155) uses hash anchors (`#privacy`, `#terms`, `#security`) instead of proper routes.

## Documentation Guidance

The `marketing-website-prompt.md` provides clear guidance on:
- About page should include team/company info
- Blog should have categories, post listings, and MDX support
- Privacy/Terms are standard legal pages
- All pages should follow SEO best practices


### Approach

## Implementation Strategy

Create four new pages following the established patterns in the codebase:

1. **About Page**: Company overview, mission, team information, and values
2. **Blog Page**: Blog landing page with featured posts and categories (placeholder for future MDX integration)
3. **Privacy Policy**: Comprehensive privacy policy with sections for data collection, usage, and rights
4. **Terms of Service**: Standard terms including usage rights, limitations, and legal disclaimers

Each page will:
- Follow the existing page structure (Navigation → content → Footer)
- Include proper SEO metadata using Next.js Metadata API
- Use framer-motion animations for consistency
- Utilize shadcn/ui components (Card, Badge, Tabs, etc.)
- Be fully responsive and accessible
- Include structured data where appropriate

Additionally, update the footer to fix the bottom section links to use proper routes instead of hash anchors.


### Reasoning

I explored the `lattice-website` folder structure and identified that it's a Next.js application using the App Router. I examined existing pages (`page.tsx`, `downloads/page.tsx`, `support/page.tsx`, `status/page.tsx`) to understand the consistent patterns used throughout the site. I reviewed the navigation and footer components to identify which pages are referenced but missing. I also checked the layout file, SEO utilities, and structured data components to understand the metadata and SEO patterns. Finally, I reviewed the marketing documentation to understand content expectations for the missing pages.

### lattice-website\src\components\footer.tsx(MODIFY)

References: 

- lattice-website\src\app\about\page.tsx(NEW)
- lattice-website\src\app\blog\page.tsx(NEW)
- lattice-website\src\app\privacy\page.tsx(NEW)
- lattice-website\src\app\terms\page.tsx(NEW)

Update the footer component to fix the bottom section links that currently use hash anchors.

**Changes to make:**

1. **Lines 147-155** (bottom section links): Replace the hash anchor links with proper route links:
   - Change `href="#privacy"` to `href="/privacy"`
   - Change `href="#terms"` to `href="/terms"`
   - For the "Security" link at line 153-155:
     - Either remove it (if no security page exists yet)
     - Or keep it as a placeholder with `href="/security"` for future implementation
     - Or change it to link to the status page `href="/status"` as a temporary measure

2. **Verify existing links** (lines 23-26 in the `company` section):
   - These already correctly point to `/about`, `/blog`, `/privacy`, `/terms`
   - No changes needed here

**Reasoning:**
The footer currently has inconsistent linking - the main footer sections use proper routes while the bottom copyright section uses hash anchors. This creates broken links and inconsistent navigation. By updating to proper routes, users can navigate to the legal pages from both locations in the footer.
