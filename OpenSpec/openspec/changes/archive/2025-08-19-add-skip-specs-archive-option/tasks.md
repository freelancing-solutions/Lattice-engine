## 1. Update Archive Command Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add `skipSpecs` option to the archive command options interface
- [x] 1.2 Modify the execute method to skip spec operations when flag is set
- [x] 1.3 Fix confirmation behavior: when user declines spec updates, proceed with archiving instead of cancelling
- [x] 1.4 Update console output to indicate when specs are being skipped (via flag or user choice)
- [x] 1.5 Ensure archive continues after declining spec updates

## 2. Update CLI Interface
- [x] 2.1 Add `--skip-specs` flag to the archive command definition
- [x] 2.2 Pass the flag value to the archive command execute method

## 3. Update Tests
- [x] 3.1 Add test case for archiving with --skip-specs flag
- [x] 3.2 Add test case for declining spec updates but continuing with archive
- [x] 3.3 Verify that spec updates are skipped when flag is used
- [x] 3.4 Verify that archive proceeds when user declines spec updates
- [x] 3.5 Ensure existing behavior remains unchanged when flag is not used

## 4. Update Documentation
- [x] 4.1 Update the cli-archive spec to document the new --skip-specs flag
- [x] 4.2 Document the new behavior when declining spec updates interactively

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Non-blocking Confirmation Behavior**: When users decline spec updates interactively, the archive operation continues rather than cancelling entirely. This was a critical UX improvement because:
   - Users may want to review specs separately before updating them
   - Archiving work shouldn't be blocked by spec review decisions
   - Maintains flexibility in the deployment workflow

2. **Flag Naming Convention**: Chose `--skip-specs` for clarity and consistency:
   - Clearly indicates the action (skipping) and target (specs)
   - Follows kebab-case convention for CLI flags
   - Converts naturally to `skipSpecs` camelCase in code

3. **Console Messaging Strategy**: Added explicit messages for all spec-skipping scenarios:
   - When flag is used: "Skipping spec updates (--skip-specs flag provided)."
   - When user declines: "Skipping spec updates. Proceeding with archive."
   - Ensures users always understand what's happening with their specs

4. **Test Coverage Approach**: Created separate test cases for:
   - Flag-based skipping (explicit user choice via CLI)
   - Interactive declining (runtime user decision)
   - Both verify the same outcome but test different code paths

### Use Cases Addressed

- **Infrastructure Changes**: Changes to build tools, CI/CD, dependencies
- **Documentation Updates**: README updates, comment improvements
- **Tooling Modifications**: Developer tools, scripts, configuration files
- **Refactoring**: Code improvements that don't change functionality/specs

### Future Considerations

- Could potentially auto-detect when changes don't include specs and suggest using the flag
- May want to track which archives skipped spec updates for audit purposes
