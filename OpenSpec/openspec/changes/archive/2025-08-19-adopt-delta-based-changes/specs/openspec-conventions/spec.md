# OpenSpec Conventions - Changes

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Header-Based Requirement Identification

Requirement headers SHALL serve as unique identifiers for programmatic matching between current specs and proposed changes.

#### Scenario: Matching requirements programmatically

- **WHEN** processing delta changes
- **THEN** use the `### Requirement: [Name]` header as the unique identifier
- **AND** match using normalized headers: `normalize(header) = trim(header)`
- **AND** compare headers with case-sensitive equality after normalization

#### Scenario: Handling requirement renames

- **WHEN** renaming a requirement
- **THEN** use a special `## RENAMED Requirements` section
- **AND** specify both old and new names explicitly:
  ```markdown
  ## RENAMED Requirements
  - FROM: `### Requirement: Old Name`
  - TO: `### Requirement: New Name`
  ```
- **AND** if content also changes, include under MODIFIED using the NEW header

#### Scenario: Validating header uniqueness

- **WHEN** creating or modifying requirements
- **THEN** ensure no duplicate headers exist within a spec
- **AND** validation tools SHALL flag duplicate headers as errors

### Requirement: Change Storage Convention

Change proposals SHALL store only the additions, modifications, and removals to specifications, not complete future states.

#### Scenario: Creating change proposals with additions

- **WHEN** creating a change proposal that adds new requirements
- **THEN** include only the new requirements under `## ADDED Requirements`
- **AND** each requirement SHALL include its complete content
- **AND** use the standard structured format for requirements and scenarios

#### Scenario: Creating change proposals with modifications  

- **WHEN** creating a change proposal that modifies existing requirements
- **THEN** include the modified requirements under `## MODIFIED Requirements`
- **AND** use the same header text as in the current spec (normalized)
- **AND** include the complete modified requirement (not a diff)
- **AND** optionally annotate what changed with inline comments like `← (was X)`

#### Scenario: Creating change proposals with removals

- **WHEN** creating a change proposal that removes requirements
- **THEN** list them under `## REMOVED Requirements`
- **AND** use the normalized header text for identification
- **AND** include reason for removal
- **AND** document any migration path if applicable


The `changes/[name]/specs/` directory SHALL contain:
- Delta files showing only what changes
- Sections for ADDED, MODIFIED, REMOVED, and RENAMED requirements
- Normalized header matching for requirement identification
- Complete requirements using the structured format
- Clear indication of change type for each requirement

#### Scenario: Using standard output symbols

- **WHEN** displaying delta operations in CLI output
- **THEN** use these standard symbols:
  - `+` for ADDED (green)
  - `~` for MODIFIED (yellow)
  - `-` for REMOVED (red)
  - `→` for RENAMED (cyan)

### Requirement: Archive Process Enhancement

The archive process SHALL programmatically apply delta changes to current specifications using header-based matching.

#### Scenario: Archiving changes with deltas

- **WHEN** archiving a completed change
- **THEN** the archive command SHALL:
  1. Parse RENAMED sections first and apply renames
  2. Parse REMOVED sections and remove by normalized header match
  3. Parse MODIFIED sections and replace by normalized header match (using new names if renamed)
  4. Parse ADDED sections and append new requirements
- **AND** validate that all MODIFIED/REMOVED headers exist in current spec
- **AND** validate that ADDED headers don't already exist
- **AND** generate the updated spec in the main specs/ directory

#### Scenario: Handling conflicts during archive

- **WHEN** delta changes conflict with current spec state
- **THEN** the archive command SHALL report specific conflicts
- **AND** require manual resolution before proceeding
- **AND** provide clear guidance on resolving conflicts
