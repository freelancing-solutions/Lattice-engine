# Validate Command

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Validation SHALL provide actionable remediation steps
Validation output SHALL include specific guidance to fix each error, including expected structure, example headers, and suggested commands to verify fixes.

#### Scenario: No deltas found in change
- **WHEN** validating a change with zero parsed deltas
- **THEN** show error "No deltas found" with guidance:
  - Ensure `openspec/changes/{id}/specs/` exists with `.md` files
  - Use delta headers: `## ADDED Requirements`, `## MODIFIED Requirements`, `## REMOVED Requirements`, `## RENAMED Requirements`
  - Each requirement must include at least one `#### Scenario:` block
  - Try: `openspec change show {id} --json --deltas-only` to inspect what was parsed

#### Scenario: Missing required sections
- **WHEN** a required section is missing
- **THEN** the validator SHALL include expected header names and a minimal skeleton:
  - For Spec: `## Purpose`, `## Requirements`
  - For Change: `## Why`, `## What Changes`
  - Show an example snippet of the missing section

### Requirement: Validator SHALL detect likely misformatted scenarios and warn with a fix
The validator SHALL recognize bulleted lines that look like scenarios (e.g., lines beginning with WHEN/THEN/AND) and emit a targeted warning with a conversion example to `#### Scenario:`.

#### Scenario: Bulleted WHEN/THEN under a Requirement
- **WHEN** bullets that start with WHEN/THEN/AND are found under a requirement without any `#### Scenario:` headers
- **THEN** emit warning: "Scenarios must use '#### Scenario:' headers", and show a conversion template:
```
#### Scenario: Short name
- **WHEN** ...
- **THEN** ...
- **AND** ...
```

### Requirement: All issues SHALL include file paths and structured locations
Error, warning, and info messages SHALL include:
- Source file path (`openspec/changes/{id}/proposal.md`, `.../specs/{cap}/spec.md`)
- Structured path (e.g., `deltas[0].requirements[0].scenarios`)

#### Scenario: Zod validation error
- **WHEN** a schema validation fails
- **THEN** the message SHALL include `file`, `path`, and a remediation hint if applicable

### Requirement: Invalid results SHALL include a Next steps footer in human-readable output
The CLI SHALL append a Next steps footer when the item is invalid and not using `--json`, including:
- Summary line with counts
- Top-3 guidance bullets (contextual to the most frequent or blocking errors)
- A suggestion to re-run with `--json` and/or the debug command

#### Scenario: Change invalid summary
- **WHEN** a change validation fails
- **THEN** print "Next steps" with 2-3 targeted bullets and suggest `openspec change show <id> --json --deltas-only`
