## Why

Currently, users must validate changes and specs individually by specifying each ID. This creates friction when:
- Teams want to validate all changes/specs before a release
- Developers need to ensure consistency across multiple related changes  
- Users run validation commands without arguments and receive errors instead of helpful guidance
- The subcommand structure requires users to know in advance whether they're validating a change or spec

## What Changes

- Add new top-level `validate` command with intuitive flags (--all, --changes, --specs)
- Enhance existing `change validate` and `spec validate` to support interactive selection (backwards compatibility)
- Interactive selection by default when no arguments provided
- Support direct item validation: `openspec validate <item>` with automatic type detection

## Impact

- New specs to create: cli-validate
- Specs to enhance: cli-change, cli-spec (for backwards compatibility)
- Affected code: src/cli/index.ts, src/commands/validate.ts (new), src/commands/spec.ts, src/commands/change.ts
