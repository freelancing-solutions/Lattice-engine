## 1. Planning & Spec Updates

## 2. Implementation
- [x] 2.1 Add multi-select support to the `openspec init` prompt, including indicators for existing tool configs
- [x] 2.2 Enhance success messaging to summarize created/refreshed assets per tool
- [x] 2.3 Ensure shared instruction template is applied consistently (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, slash commands)

## 3. Quality

- [x] 3.2 Perform `openspec init` smoke test in a temp directory (document output)
