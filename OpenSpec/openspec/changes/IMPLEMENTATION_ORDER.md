# Implementation Order and Dependencies

## Required Implementation Sequence

The following changes must be implemented in this specific order due to dependencies:

### Phase 1: Foundation
**1. add-zod-validation** (No dependencies)
- Creates all core schemas (RequirementSchema, ScenarioSchema, SpecSchema, ChangeSchema, DeltaSchema)
- Implements markdown parser utilities
- Implements validation infrastructure and rules
- Establishes validation patterns used by all commands
- Must be completed first

### Phase 2: Change Commands
**2. add-change-commands** (Depends on: add-zod-validation)
- Imports ChangeSchema and DeltaSchema from zod validation
- Reuses markdown parsing utilities
- Implements change command with built-in validation
- Uses validation infrastructure for change validate subcommand
- Cannot start until schemas and validation exist

### Phase 3: Spec Commands
**3. add-spec-commands** (Depends on: add-zod-validation, add-change-commands)
- Imports RequirementSchema, ScenarioSchema, SpecSchema from zod validation
- Reuses markdown parsing utilities
- Implements spec command with built-in validation
- Uses validation infrastructure for spec validate subcommand
- Builds on patterns established by change commands

## Key Dependencies

### Shared Code Dependencies
1. **Schemas**: All schemas created in add-zod-validation, used by both command implementations
2. **Validation**: Infrastructure created in add-zod-validation, integrated into both commands
3. **Parsers**: Markdown parsing utilities created in add-zod-validation, used by both commands

### File Dependencies
- `src/core/schemas/*.schema.ts` (created by add-zod-validation) → imported by both commands
- `src/core/validation/validator.ts` (created by add-zod-validation) → used by both commands
- `src/core/parsers/markdown-parser.ts` (created by add-zod-validation) → used by both commands

## Implementation Notes

### For Developers
1. Complete each phase fully before moving to the next
2. Run tests after each phase to ensure stability
3. The legacy `list` command remains functional throughout

### For CI/CD
1. Each change can be validated independently
2. Integration tests should run after each phase
3. Full system tests required after Phase 3

### Parallel Work Opportunities
Within each phase, the following can be done in parallel:
- **Phase 1**: Schema design, validation rules, and parser implementation
- **Phase 2**: Change command features and legacy compatibility work
- **Phase 3**: Spec command features and final integration
