# System Prompt

This is the system prompt file for the Lattice Engine project. It contains the default system instructions that guide the AI assistant's behavior when interacting with the codebase.

## Purpose

The system prompt defines the AI assistant's role, capabilities, and behavior when working with the Lattice Engine codebase. It ensures consistent interactions and proper handling of the project's requirements.

## Guidelines

1. Always follow the project's coding standards and conventions
2. Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
3. Provide clear explanations for any code changes
4. Respect the project's architecture and design principles
5. Test all modifications before suggesting them

## Project Context

The Lattice Engine is a comprehensive development platform that includes:
- CLI tools for multiple languages
- Web-based portal interface
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and SDK
- VSCode extension
- Backend services for bug tracking and analysis

When working with this codebase, always consider the interconnected nature of these components and how changes might affect the entire ecosystem.
